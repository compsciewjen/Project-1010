# Project-1010

# Abstract 
This project analyses how various factors predict life satisfaction. It will focus on community-based variables including location, income, race/ethnicity, etc. Because there are many factors that can impact happiness, we will first use a LLM to 'read' several studies of happiness and determine the factors that are the most prevalent. Then we will use those variables to make a regression model that predicts happiness.

# Motivation 
We are interested in how demographic factors and life decisions influence one’s life–particularly one’s ability to enjoy it. Which communities are likely to have happy people? Which ones aren’t? Can a higher income predict your happiness? Do people living in a certains cities hold the secret?
Not only is happiness relevant for personal quality of life, but also for the overall stability of families, communities, and countries.
