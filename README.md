# Project-1010

# Goal 
Our project was created to help identify the factors that most strongly predict happiness by analyzing existing research. Our aim is to examine variables that relate to happiness to better understand which environments best support people’s ability to enjoy their lives. 

# Background 
We are interested in how both circumstances and perspectives influence individuals’ lives, particularly their ability to enjoy them. What mindsets and attributes do happy people have? Which ones do they not have? Are people at a certain age or income bracket happier?

To answer our questions, we utilize two main resources: the General Social Survey Data Explorer (GSS), and the World Happiness Report (WHR). GSS is a well-established organization which has been conducting comprehensive social surveys since 1973. The World Happiness Report is “the world’s foremost publication on global wellbeing and how to improve it.”⁶

In this study, we aim to identify variables that are most heavily correlated to happiness. We use various methods, incorporating GSS and WHR, to reduce the potential variables from almost 7,000 to the 3 most influential.

# Ethical, Social, and Legal Implications
Although our findings suggest that mindset plays a significant role in happiness, they do not diminish the importance of addressing material inequality. These insights should motivate personal growth while reinforcing our responsibility to support fair opportunities for everyone.

Our project utilizes variables from the World Happiness Report database that encourages discussion around economic disparities, social factors, and mental health across different populations. Happiness is measured through self-reported subjective well-being which can be influenced by personal bias, cultural norms, and social expectations.
